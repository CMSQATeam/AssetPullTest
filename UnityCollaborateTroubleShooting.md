Collaborate troubleshooting tips
================================

This page details some simple troubleshooting tips for the most common problems that might arise while using Unity Collaborate. You can also visit the [Collaborate section of the Unity forum](http://forum.unity3d.com/forums/collaborate.98/) for further assistance.

* If the information in Collab History appears to be out of date (for example, if the time next to it doesn't look like when the most recent changes have been pushed), right-click on the Collab History tab and select Reload for the most recently updated information.

* If you notice that the loading cog has been spinning for a long time, or if the upload stops at 99%, Collab might be stuck. First, check that youâ€™re connected to the internet. If your internet connection has failed, Collab is unable to update. If your internet connection is active, please restart Unity and try again.

* If your local project state is the state you want, and your Cloud project state is giving you too many conflicts or problems, open the __Services__ tab and navigate to __Settings__. From here, click __Unlink project__, then re-link the project with a new ID to submit a clean new version of your project. To do this, click __Select organization__ in the Services panel and follow the steps to assign or create an ID.

* If your Cloud project state is the state you want, and your local project state is giving you too many conflicts or problems, there are two ways to revert to the Cloud version:

    * Open the __Collab History__ window (__Window__ > __Collab History__), navigate to the latest revision, and click __Restore__

    * From the Unity Launch Screen, click __Open__ and then __In the Cloud__ to open the last version saved to the Cloud.

* If both your local project state and your Cloud project state are having problems, but you have an older version you want to go back to Open __Collab History__ and click __Go back to...__, then unlink the project and re-link it with a new ID (as show in the image above) to submit a clean new version of your project.
