# Windows Store: IL2CPP scripting back end

IL2CPP is a fully-supported scripting back end that can be used as an alternative to .NET when building projects for Windows Store. When building a project using IL2CPP, Unity converts IL code from scripts and assemblies to C++ before creating a native binary. Refer to the Unity Manual page on [IL2CPP](IL2CPP) for more information. 

IL2CPP is only supported when targeting Windows 10 SDK.
