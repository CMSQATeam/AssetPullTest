Expert Guides
=======

![](../uploads/Main/TimeToShineHeader.jpg) 

Our Expert Guides section draws together pieces of work written by area experts, and gives you detailed insight into features and topics. These documents tend to differ from the rest of Unity's documentation - both in writing style and content. They represent some of the best developers providing their own insight into the workings of Unity and how to get the most out of it. 

Some of these documents originated as blog posts, which we are collecting for convenience here to prevent them from being buried under the constant flow of new posts on our site. Others have been written specificially for this section by developers who want to get their knowledge into your hands directly. Because their length and format differs from the the User Manual's normal style, we provide them to you as downloadable PDFs.
