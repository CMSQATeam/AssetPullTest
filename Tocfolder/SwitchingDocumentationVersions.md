#Switching between Unity versions in the documentation

The Unity Manual and Scripting API hold documentation for several versions of Unity. You can switch between the two latest versions by clicking on the link at the top-left of this page, above the table of contents.

It is not currently possible to look at an individual Unity documentation page and switch between its versions. Switching versions always takes you back to the home page.
