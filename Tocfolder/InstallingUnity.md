# Downloading and installing Unity

### Installing Unity on Windows from command line

The following options can be used when installing the Unity Editor and other components from command line on Windows. Note that installer command line arguments are case-sensitive.



## Installing several versions at once

You can install as many versions of Unity as you like on the same computer. 

The installer on a Mac creates a folder called __Unity__, and overwrite any existing folder with this name -  however, if you rename the folder to something else before installing another versions, then both versions can exist on the same computer without problems. 

On a PC, the install folder is always named __Unity X.Y.Z[fp]W__, where the 'f' is for an official release, and 'p' is used to mark a patch release.

We strongly recommend that if you rename a Unity folder, you choose the new folder name logically (for example, add the version number to the end of the name). Note that any existing shortcuts, aliases and links to the offline docs may no longer point to the old version of Unity. This can be particularly confusing with the offline docs; if you suddenly find that browser bookmarks to the offline docs no longer work, then check that they have the right folder name in the URL.
