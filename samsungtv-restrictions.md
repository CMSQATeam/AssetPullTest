# SamsungTV Restrictions

Because of the security model on Samsung Smart TV, the following restrictions are enforced:

* [Security model](SecuritySandboxSamsungTV) is active. (Note that the _cross domain policy parsing_ of the security model does **not apply** to Samsung TV)
* File access is not allowed.  Please use [PlayerPrefs](ScriptRef:PlayerPrefs.html) to persist user data.
* Native plugins are only allowed if signed by Samsung.  If you are interested in developing a native plugin for Samsung TV, please post on the forum.
