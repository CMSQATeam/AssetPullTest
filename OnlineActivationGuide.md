#Online Activation

Online activation is the easiest and fastest way to get up and running with Unity. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to activate Unity online.

1. Download and install the Unity Editor. The latest version of Unity can be found [here](http://unity3d.com/unity/download/).

1. Fire up the Editor from your Applications folder on OS X or the shortcut in the Start Menu on Windows.

1. Firstly, you will encounter the 'Unity Account' window. Here you will need to enter your Unity Developer Network account credentials. (If you donâ€™t have an existing account or have forgotten your password, simply click the respective 'Create account' and 'Forgot your password?' button and links. Follow the onscreen prompts to create or retrieve your account.) Once your credentials are entered you can proceed by clicking 'OK'.
