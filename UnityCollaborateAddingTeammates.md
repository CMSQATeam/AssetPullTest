Adding teammates to Collaborate
===============================

Adding teammates allows everyone to share their work.

Add teammates to Collaborate by opening the **Collab** window and clicking the **People** icon shown at the bottom.

This opens up the **Members** section (also found within the Services menu). Invite a teammate to be added to the project by entering their email address and clicking **Invite**.
