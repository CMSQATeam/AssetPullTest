##Properties

|**_Property:_** |**_Function:_** |
|:---|:---|
|**Unity Remote** ||
|__Device__|The device type you will use for remote testing (Android, iOS or none).|
|__Compression__ |The type of image compression used when transmitting the game screen to the device. JPEG typically gives higher compression and performance while PNG gives a more accurate representation of the game display. |
|__Resolution__ |Selects whether the device should show the game display at normal resolution (for graphical accuracy) or _downsized_ (for performance). |
|**Version Control** | |
|__Mode__|The version control system that should be used. Different options are available for different systems as described in [this section](VersionControl) of the manual. |
|**Asset Serialization** | |
|__Mode__|To assist with version control merges, Unity can store scene files in a text-based format (see the [text scene format](TextSceneFormat) pages for further details). If scene merges will not be performed then Unity can store scenes in a more space efficient binary format or allow both text and binary scene files to exist at the same time.|
|**Default Behavior Mode** | |
|__Mode__|Chooses between 2D or 3D editor mode. See [2D or 3D Projects](2Dor3D) for more information.|
|**Sprite Packer**| |
|__Mode__|This chooses whether the [Sprite Packer](SpritePacker) is always enabled, enabled for builds only or completely disabled.|
