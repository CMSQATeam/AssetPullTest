#The Learn tab

The __Learn__ tab in the Home window gives you access to a variety of tutorials and learning resources (including example Projects that you can import directly into Unity) to help you get started with Unity. 

The Learn tab is visible in the Home window after Unity is opened. The Home window can also be accessed from within the Editor by navigating to __File__ > __New__ __Project__.

The Learn tab is split into four sections: 

* __Get Started__

* __Tutorials__

* __Resources__

* __Links__

##Get Started

The __Get Started__ section contains a short welcome video that introduces the resources available to you as a Unity developer. 

## Tutorials

The __Tutorials__ section contains a list of tutorial Projects that you can import into Unity. 

Each tutorial includes written and video guides, along with a full example Project and all the resources you need to complete the Project yourself. 

To access the video guides and full tutorials, click the __Read More__ button to the right of the Project you want to know more about.

To download and import a tutorial Project into Unity, click the __Download__ button to the right of the relevant Project. Unity then downloads all of the required Assets for the tutorial Project you have selected. When the download has finished, click the __Start__ button to automatically create and open a new Project that contains all of the resources you need to follow the tutorial.

You can follow your chosen tutorial on the [Unity Learn](https://unity3d.com/learn) website. 

## Resources

The __Resources __section contains links to [Asset Packages](#AssetPackages) that can be imported into your Project. Asset Packages contain resources such as 3D models, Particle effects, and pre-made scripts that you can use to quickly build Projects. 

To download an Asset Package from the Learn tab, click the __Download__ button to the right of the Asset Package you want to download. Unity then automatically downloads all of the Assets included in your chosen Asset Package.

To use these Assets in a Project, click the __Launch__ button (shown in the screenshot below). Unity then automatically creates and opens a Project containing the downloaded Assets.
