# Post-processing overview

Post-processing provides a quick, simple way to change and improve the look of your game. It’s easiest to think of them like adding filters to images, like you might do in Photoshop or Instagram.

Post-processing applies full-screen filters and effects to a camera’s image buffer before it is displayed to screen. You can use image post-processing effects to simulate physical camera and film properties.

### Using post-processing

To use post-processing in your project, you can import the official post-processing stack via the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/83912). You can also write your own post-processing effects. For details on how to do this, see documentation on [Writing post-processing effects](PostProcessingWritingEffects).

The images below demonstrate a [Scene](CreatingScenes) with and without post-processing.
