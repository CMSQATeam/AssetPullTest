Unity Collaborate
=================

Unity Collaborate is a simple way for small teams to save, share, and sync their Unity project. It's cloud-hosted and easy to use, so your entire team can contribute to the Project, regardless of location or role.

Collaborate works best for teams of 1-10 people. It is ideal for multi-disciplinary teams (that is, teams with a diverse mix of developers, artists, audio experts and other specialists) looking to work on the same projects.

Collaborate is in Open Beta. Please note that because the service is in Beta, Unity is collecting feedback from users to help improve the feature and ensure it meets your team's needs.

To enable Collaborate, open the __Services__ window in the Unity Editor (menu: __Window__ > __Services__). To launch Collaborate while you're working, click the __Collab__ button in the Unity Editor.
