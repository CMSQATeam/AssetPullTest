# OpenVR

## Getting Started (OpenVR)

Steam is required to run OpenVR applications, so install Steam and SteamVR. Once SteamVR is working properly with your headset, add **OpenVR** to the list of supported SDKs (see below to learn how to do this). If you require additional functionality beyond Unityâ€™s built-in support, see the [SteamVR asset store package](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/32647).

##Inputs
See documentation on [OpenVR Controllers](OpenVRControllers) for input control mapping. 

## Upgrading a project that contains the SteamVR Package

* Enable virtual reality support. Open the __Player Settings__ (menu: __Edit__ > __Project Settings__ > __Player__), select __Other Settings__ and check the __Virtual Reality Supported__ checkbox. 
* Use the __Virtual Reality SDK__ list displayed below the checkbox to add OpenVR.
* Enter Play Mode in the Editor to test the build.
