#Input

Unity supports the conventional types of input device used with games (keyboard, joypad, etc) but also the touchscreens and movement-sensing capabilities of mobile devices. These types of input are covered in this section.

Additionally, Unity can make use of a computer's microphone and webcam to input audio and video data. See the [Audio](Audio) and [Graphics](Graphics) sections of the manual for further information.
