Unity Hotkeys
=============


This page gives an overview of the default Unity Hotkeys. You can also download a PDF of the table for [Windows](../uploads/Main/Unity_HotKeys_Win.pdf) and [MacOSX](../uploads/Main/Unity_HotKeys_Mac.pdf). Where a command has __CTRL/CMD__ as part of the keystroke, this indicates that the __Control__ key should be used on Windows and the __Command__ key on MacOSX.

The Mac trackpad also has a number of shortcuts for navigating the Scene view. See [Scene view navigation](SceneViewNavigation) to learn more about these.
