GameObjects
===========

The __GameObject__ is the most important concept in the Unity Editor. 

Every object in your game is a __GameObject__. This means that everything you can think of to be in your game has to be a __GameObject__. However, a __GameObject__ can't do anything on its own; you need to give it properties before it can become a character, an environment, or a special effect.

A __GameObject__ is a container; you add pieces to the __GameObject__ container to make it into a character, a light, a tree, a sound, or whatever else you would like it to be. Each piece you add is called a __component__.

Depending on what kind of object you want to create, you add different combinations of __components__ to a __GameObject__. 
You can think of a __GameObject__ as an empty cooking pot, and __components__ as different ingredients that make up your recipe of gameplay. Unity has lots of different built-in __component__ types, and you can also make your own __components__ using the [Unity Scripting API](CreatingComponents).

This section explains how __GameObjects__, [components](Components) and [Scripting API](CreatingComponents) fit together, and how to create and use them.
