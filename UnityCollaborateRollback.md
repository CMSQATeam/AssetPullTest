# Rollback

Use Rollback to go back to a previous update of your Project and publish those changes again as the most recent files. Rollback ensures that all versions of your Project are intact, even after a rollback, and they can be accessed at any time in the development cycle.

To roll back to a previous publish:

![Image A: Click on __Open the history panel__ in the Services Collaborate window to access Rollback
](../uploads/Main/Rollback1.png)

1. In the Unity Editor, open the Services window, and select __Collaborate__.

2. In the  Collaborate window, select __Open the history panel__ to display the __Collab History__ window. Here you can see your Projectâ€™s change history.

3. Click __Go Back To...__ on the change you would like to revert to (see Image B). This replaces all local Project files with the files from the older version. These files are now listed as modified in the Collaborate toolbar. A blue __plus sign__ (__+__) on a file or folder means it is modified. A blue __arrow__ (__->__) on a file or folder means it is new (see Image C).

4. Click __Publish now!__ to publish these files as a new revision for your Project.
