# Partial Publish

Use the __Partial Publish__ feature to publish specific Project files to [Collaborate](UnityCollaborate) instead of all of the files in a Project. This means you donâ€™t have to publish all of your work before it is ready, or risk losing your local work by not publishing it to Collaborate.
