A __Light Probe Group__ adds one or more [light probes](LightProbes) to a scene.

A new probe can be created by clicking the __Add Probe__ button in the inspector. Once created, the probe can be selected and moved in much the same way as a GameObject and can be deleted by typing Ctrl/Cmd + Backspace.
