#Asset Bundles

Asset Bundles are a collection of assets, packaged for loading at runtime. With Asset Bundles, you can dynamically load and unload new content into your application. AssetBundles can be used to implement post-release DLC. 

They can be used to reduce the amount of space on disk used by your game, when first deployed. It can also be used to add new content to an already published game.
