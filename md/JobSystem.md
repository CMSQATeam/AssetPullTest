# C# Job System

The Unity C# Job System lets you write simple and safe multithreaded code that interacts with the Unity Engine for enhanced game performance. 

You can use the C# Job System with the Unity [Entity Component System](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples) (ECS), which is an architecture that makes it simple to create efficient machine code for all platforms.
