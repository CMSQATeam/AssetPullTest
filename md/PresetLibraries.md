# Swatch libraries

Use swatch libraries to reuse, save, and share colors, gradients, and animation curves. You can save and choose swatches in the [Color Picker](EditingValueProperties), [Gradient Editor](EditingValueProperties), and [Curve Editor](EditingValueProperties).

A swatch library is a collection of swatches that you save in a file. The Swatches section displays a single library at a time.

To save a swatch:

1. Open the Color Picker, Gradient Editor, or Curve Editor. For example, select __Main Camera__ in the [Hierarchy](Hierarchy) window.
1. In the [Inspector](UsingTheInspector) window, click __Background Color__.
1. In the picker window, adjust the color, gradient, or curve to your liking.
1. In __Swatches__, click the outlined box.
1. If the view is in List mode, optionally type a name for the swatch.

Drag and drop swatches to change their order. Right-click a swatch to move it to the top, replace it, rename it, or delete it. You can also delete a swatch by Alt/Option-clicking it.

Use the drop-down menu in __Swatches__ to:

* Choose __List__ or __Grid__ to change the view. The List view also displays the names of swatches.
* Choose a swatch library.
* Choose __Create a Library__ to create a new swatch library and the location to save it in.
* Choose __Reveal Current Library Location__ to view the current library in Windows Explorer/Mac OS Finder.

By default, Unity saves swatch libraries in your user preferences. You can also save a swatch library in your Project. Unity saves Project swatch libraries in the _Editor_ folder of the _Assets_ folder. To share Project swatch libraries between users, or to include them in a package, add them to a revision control repository.

To edit a Project swatch library:

1. Select the swatch library in the [Project](ProjectView) window.
2. In the [Inspector](UsingTheInspector) window, click __Edit__.
