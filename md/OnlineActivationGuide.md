#Online activation

If your machine has internet access, you can activate your new Unity license online through the Unity Editor. 

To actival a new license for Unity Plus or Pro, you must have a Unity Plus or Pro license, and your serial number, which Unity emails to you. If you don't have a Unity license, speak to the Owner of your license, or contact [Unity Customer Services](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=65905). 

## Open the License Management window
If you already have Unity installed, open it, and in the top menu go to __Unity__ &gt; __Manage License__. 

If you don't have Unity installed, download and install the Unity Editor. Go to [Download Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) to get the latest version. If you're not sure which type of license you need, go to the [Unity Store](https://store.unity.com/) and view comparisons for Unity Personal, Plus and Pro. 

Open the Editor and sign into your Unity ID. If you donâ€™t have an existing Unity account, [create one](https://id.unity.com/account/new).

When you log into Unity for the first time, the License management window appears. 

If you already have Unity installed, or if the License management window doesn't appear, navigate to the top menu and go to __Unity__ &gt; __Manage License__.
