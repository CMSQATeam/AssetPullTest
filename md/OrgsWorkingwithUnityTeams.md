# Working with Unity Teams

Unity Teams enables creative teams to work more efficiently together with features that enable collaboration and simplify workflows.

Unity Teams consists of the following services:

* Unity Collaborate: Save, share, and sync your projects and use simple version control and cloud storage, all seamlessly integrated with Unity. For more information, see [Unity Collaborate](UnityCollaborate).
* Unity Cloud Build: Automatically share builds with team members. If you subscribe to Teams Advanced you can build your Project in the cloud. For more information, see [Unity Cloud Build](UnityCloudBuild).

Every Unity Project is associated with an Organization. Organizations are the container for your Unity subscription services.

When you need to purchase additional Editor seats, you create a subscription under an Organization and add seat licenses under it. When you assign an Editor seat to a Project user, it is assigned from one of your subscriptions.

Team seats are attached directly to an Organization.  When you create your first Project, you get a Teams Basic subscription that has three Team seats.  If you subscribe to Teams Advanced, the seats you buy are added to the Organization.

For Project team member to use Unity Teams, you must assign them a Team seat in your organization. You might also need to assign them an Editor seat if their license level does not match the license level of your Subscription.

When working with Unity Teams seats, remember that:

* Unity Teams seats are separate from Editor seats.
* Your Unity Teams seats are attached to your Organization, not a subscription under the Organization.

Subscribe to Unity Teams Advanced if you need to:

* Collaborate with more than two other people
* Use the full features of [Cloud Build](UnityCloudBuild)
* Use more [cloud storage](OrgsManagingyourOrganization#membersandgroups)
* Get an extensive version history for Projects on which you collaborate

For more information on assigning a Unity Teams seat user, see [Adding team members to your Unity Project](UnityCollaborateAddingTeammates).
