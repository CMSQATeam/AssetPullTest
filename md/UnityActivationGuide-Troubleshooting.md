## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any error codes or other problems during the activation process, they might be caused by the following issues:

* Your machine might not have internet access.
* Unity's license servers might be down. See the [Unity Cloud System Status Page](https://status.cloud.unity3d.com/) for status updates on the all Unity servers.
* Your firewall settings might be blocking Unity from sending and receiving data about your license file.
* You might not have the correct read/write privileges on the machine to save the license file. This is a particularly common problem in workplaces and schools; contact yout IT administrator to find out whether there are restrictions in palce that might prevent the activation process from working correctly.
* Major operating system changes or updates might affect your machine's ID, causing your licence to stop recognising your machine.
