# Adding Image Targets to your Scene

To add an Image Target to the Scene, go to __GameObject__ &gt; __Vuforia__ &gt; __Image__.

With the Image Target GameObject in your Scene, select it and look at the __Inspector__ window to view its components.

In the __Image Target Behaviour__ component, click on the __Database__ drop-down list and select your Target database. In the __Image Target__ drop-down list, select the name of your Image Target from the database.

Note: There is no need to click the __Add Target__ button, as this brings you to the Vuforia website to give you information about adding Targets to your app.

The last step is to make a 3D GameObject appear when Vuforia recognizes the Image Target.
