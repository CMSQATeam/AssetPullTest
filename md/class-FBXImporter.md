# Model Import Settings window

![The Import Settings window](../uploads/Main/classFBXImporter-Inspector.png)

When you put Model files in the Assets folder under your Unity Project, Unity automatically imports and stores them as Unity Assets. To view the import settings in the __Inspector__, click on the file in the __Project__ window. You can customize how Unity imports the selected file by setting the properties on four tabs on this window:

[![Model tab](../uploads/Main/class-FBXImporter_Model-tab.png)](FBXImporter-Model)<br/>A 3D [Model](FBXImporter-Model) can represent a character, a building, or a piece of furniture. In these cases, Unity creates multiple Assets from a single model file. In the Project window, the main imported object is a model __Prefab__. Usually there are also several __Mesh__ objects that the model Prefab references.

[![Rig tab](../uploads/Main/class-FBXImporter_Rig-tab.png)](FBXImporter-Rig)<br/>A [Rig](FBXImporter-Rig) (sometimes called a _skeleton_) comprises a set of deformers arranged in a hierarchy that animate a Mesh (sometimes called _skin_) on one or more models created in a 3D modeling application such as as Autodesk速 3ds Max速 or Autodesk速 Maya速. For __Humanoid__ and __Generic__ (non-humanoid) Models, Unity creates an __Avatar__ to reconcile the imported Rig with the Unity __GameObject__.

[![Animation tab](../uploads/Main/class-FBXImporter_Animation-tab.png)](class-AnimationClip)<br/>You can define any series of different poses occurring over a set of frames, such as walking, running, or even idling (shifting from one foot to the other) as an [Animation Clip](class-AnimationClip). You can reuse clips for any Model that has an identical Rig. Often a single file contains several different actions, each of which you can define as a specific __Animation Clip__.

[![Materials tab](../uploads/Main/class-FBXImporter_Materials-tab.png)](FBXImporter-Materials)<br/>You can extract [Materials and Textures](FBXImporter-Materials) or leave them embedded within the model. You can also adjust how Material is mapped in the Model.
