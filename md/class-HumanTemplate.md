# Human Template window

A __Human Template__ file (`*.ht`) stores a Humanoid bone mapping for a Model that you [saved on the Avatar window](class-Avatar#HumanTemplate) in a YAML format:

![A Human Template file in YAML format](../uploads/Main/classHumanTemplate-YAML.jpg) 

The __Human Template__ window displays the contents of Human Template files as standard Unity text boxes. 

![The Human Template window ](../uploads/Main/classHumanTemplate-Inspector.png) 

Each grouping represents an entry in the YAML file, with the name of the bone mapping target labelled __First__ and the name of the bone in the Model file labelled __Second__.

You can edit most of the values in this file using this property, but Unity instantly updates every change you make to the file. However, you can Undo any changes while this window is active.
