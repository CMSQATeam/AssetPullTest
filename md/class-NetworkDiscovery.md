#Network Discovery

Network Discovery is a component that allows Unity applications using the networking system to find each other on a local network (LAN). This does not allow discovery for internet play. Use the Multiplayer Service (along with MatchMaker and Relay service) to connect to . 

The Network Discovery component does not require any integration with Unity services, and is intended as a fully stand-alone solution to finding other games on your local network to connect with.
