# Universal Windows Platform: .NET Scripting Backend

The .NET scripting backend uses Microsoft's .NET to power scripting. Universal Windows Platform uses a subset of .NET 4.5. This is due to Windows Store certification requirements. This means that the platform has some incompatibilities compared to other platforms, such as a different plugin model and many missing types.

**Note**: The .NET scripting backend is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Unity. We recommend switching to the [IL2CPP scripting backend](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html).
