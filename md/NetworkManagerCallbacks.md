# Network Manager callbacks

There are a number of events that can occur over the course of the normal operation of a multiplayer game, such as the host starting up, a player joining, or a player leaving. Each of these possible events has an associated **callback **that you can implement in your own code to take action when the event occurs.

To do this for the Network Manager, you need to create your own script which inherits from [NetworkManager](ScriptRef:Networking.NetworkManager). You can then [override](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/override) the virtual methods on NetworkManager with your own implementation of what should happen when the given event occurs. 

This page lists all the virtual methods (the callbacks) that you can implement on the Network Manager, and when they occur. The callbacks that occur, and the order they occur, vary slightly depending on whether your game is running in LAN mode or Internet (matchmaker) mode, so each modeâ€™s callbacks are listed separately below.



## LAN Callbacks

These are the callbacks that occur when the game is running on a Local Area Connection (LAN). A game can be running in one of three modes, **host**, **client**, or **server-only**. The callbacks for each mode are listed below:

### LAN callbacks in host mode:

**When the host is started:**

* `Start()` function is called

* `OnStartHost`

* `OnStartServer`

* `OnServerConnect`

* `OnStartClient`

* `OnClientConnect`

* `OnServerSceneChanged`

* `OnServerReady`

* `OnServerAddPlayer`

* `OnClientSceneChanged`

**When a client connects:**

* `OnServerConnect`

* `OnServerReady`

* `OnServerAddPlayer`

**When a client disconnects:**

* `OnServerDisconnect`

**When the host is stopped:**

* `OnStopHost`

* `OnStopServer`

* `OnStopClient`

### LAN callbacks in client mode

**When the client starts:**

* `Start()` function is called

* `OnStartClient`

* `OnClientConnect`

* `OnClientSceneChanged`

**When the client stops:**

* `OnStopClient`

* `OnClientDisconnect`

### LAN callbacks in server mode

**When the server starts:**

* `Start()` function is called

* `OnStartServer`

* `OnServerSceneChanged`

**When a client connects:**

* `OnServerConnect`

* `OnServerReady`

* `OnServerAddPlayer`

**When a client disconnects:**

* `OnServerDisconnect`

**When the server stops:**

* `OnStopServer`

## MatchMaker connection callbacks

These are the callbacks which occur when the game is running in Internet mode (i.e. when you are using the MatchMaker service to find and connect to other players. In this mode, a game can be running in one of two modes, **host**, or **client**. The callbacks for each mode are listed below:

### MatchMaker callbacks in host mode

**When the host starts:**

* `Start()` function is called

* `OnStartHost`

* `OnStartServer`

* `OnServerConnect`

* `OnStartClient`

* `OnMatchCreate`

* `OnClientConnect`

* `OnServerSceneChanged`

* `OnServerReady`

* `OnServerAddPlayer`

* `OnClientSceneChanged`


**When a client connects:**

* `OnServerConnect`

* `OnServerReady`

* `OnServerAddPlayer`


**When a client disconnects:**

* `OnServerDisconnect`

### MatchMaker callbacks in client mode

**When receiving a list of online game instances:**

* `Start()` function is called

* `OnMatchList`

**When joining a match:**

* `OnStartClient`

* `OnMatchJoined`

* `OnClientConnect`

* `OnClientSceneChanged`

**When the host stops:**

* `OnStopClient`

* `OnClientDisconnect`
