# Supporting IMGUI

Use the `IMGUIContainer` to place IMGUI code inside of a `VisualElement`. Everything you can normally do inside of `OnGUI()` is supported. 

You can arrange multiple `IMGUIContainer` and lay them out by mixing `GUILayout` and UIElements layouts. Note that it is not possible to add `VisualElement` instances inside of an `IMGUIContainer`.
