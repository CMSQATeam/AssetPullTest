# Windows Player: IL2CPP Scripting Backend

IL2CPP is a fully-supported scripting backend that can be used as an alternative to Mono when building projects for Windows Player. 

When you build a Project using IL2CPP, Unity converts IL code from scripts and assemblies to C++ before creating a native binary. See [IL2CPP](IL2CPP) for more information.
