Universal Windows Platform: Association launching
========================

The API allows you to launch the user's default app for a file type or protocol. See [UnityEngine.WSA.Launcher](ScriptRef:WSA.Launcher.html) for more information.

You can also enable your app to be the default app for a file type or protocol. You can set this information in **Player** settings. More settings are available in **Package.appxmanifest** -> **Declarations**.
