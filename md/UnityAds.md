#Unity Ads

Created by the leading mobile game engine, the Unity Ads SDK provides a comprehensive monetization framework for your game, whether you develop in Unity, xCode, or Android Studio. It streamlines ads, in-app purchasing and analytics, using cutting edge machine learning to maximize your revenue while maintaining a great player experience. Getting started is simple.

This page illustrates the journey towards maximizing your revenue with Unity Ads. Follow step by step, or jump to the integration step that best fits your stage of development.

**Note**: Many of the resources referenced here redirect to the [core Unity Ads](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/monetization/getting-started) documentation. 

## Requirements
Unity recommends always using the latest [Ads SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/add-ons/services/unity-ads-66123). The APIs discussed in many of these articles are only available in SDK versions 3.0 and higher.

## Preparation
If you are new to Unity Ads, follow these basic steps before implementation:

1. [Register](https://id.unity.com/) a Unity Developer (UDN) account on the Developer Dashboard.
2. [Configure Placements](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/monetization/placements) to receive monetization content. 
3. Download and import [the latest Unity Ads SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/add-ons/services/unity-ads-66123).
4. Review our [Best practices guide](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/resources/best-practices), to better understand your implementation strategy before diving in.

## Implementation
The following implementation resources are for games that are made with Unity:

1. [Integrate](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/unity/integration-guide-unity#basic-implementation) Unity Ads using the Monetization API.  
2. Expand your basic ads integration:<br/>i. [Reward players](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/unity/integration-guide-unity#implementing-rewarded-ads) for watching ads.<br/>ii. [Incorporate banner ads](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/unity/integration-guide-unity#implementing-banner-ads).<br/>iii. [Incorporate Augmented Reality](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/beta/ar-ads) (AR) ads.<br/>
3. If your game uses in-app purchasing, integrate [IAP Promo](IAPPromo).<br/>i. If you use Unity IAP, [click here ](IAPPromoIntegration). <br/>ii. If you use a custom IAP implementation, [click here](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/unity/purchasing-integration-unity).<br/>iii. (Optional) Customize your Promos with [Native Promo](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/beta/native-promo) assets.
4. Convert your Ads and Promo Placements into [Personalized Placements](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/monetization/placements#personalized-placements) to take advantage of Unity's revenue optimization features.

## Manage, analyze, optimize
Beyond implementation, Unity empowers you to fine-tune your strategy:

* The [Unity Developer Dashboard](https://operate.dashboard.unity3d.com/) allows you to [manage your ads implementation](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/resources/dashboard-guide). Use the dashboard's [robust metrics tools](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/resources/statistics) to adopt a data-driven approach to fine-tuning your monetization strategy.
* Learn how to [filter your ads](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/resources/dashboard-guide#ad-content-filters) to target your audience.
* Don’t miss out on revenue; be sure to [add your Store Details](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/resources/dashboard-guide#platforms) once your game is live.
* [Implement Standard Events](UnityAnalyticsStandardEvents) to help Unity’s machine learning model optimize monetization based on your game’s economy.
* Sign up for [automated payouts](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/resources/revenue-and-payment#automated-payouts).
