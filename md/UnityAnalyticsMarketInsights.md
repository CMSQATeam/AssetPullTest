# Market Insights

Use the Market Insights page to find trends in the computer hardware that players use to play Unity games.

The Market Insights page shows the relative market share of various facets of computer hardware. For example, the chart above shows the number of CPU cores a computer or device has. Each report displays the most common members of the category (after the most popular members, the market share is grouped into a single __Others__ item). Unity Analytics compiles the report data quarterly and provides historical data for the past two years.

Data for mobile and personal computer (Standalone Player) are compiled separately. Use the toolbar at the top of the page to select which set of data to view.

You can also look at separate data sets for Android and iOS on mobile, and for Windows and macOS on Standalone Players.
