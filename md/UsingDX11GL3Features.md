# DirectX

To set DirectX11 as your default Graphics API in the Editor or Standalone Player, go to the **Player** settings (menu: __Edit &gt; Project Settings__, then select the __Player__ category) and navigate to the __Other Settings__ panel. Disable the __Auto Graphics API for Windows__ property, and choose __DirectX11__ from the list. For more details, see [Graphics API support](Graphics APIs).

## Surface Shaders

Some parts of the [Surface Shader](SL-SurfaceShaders) compilation pipeline do not understand DX11-specific HLSL syntax, so if youâ€™re using HLSL features like StructuredBuffers, RWTextures and other non-DX9 syntax, you need to wrap it into a DX11-only preprocessor macro. See documentation on [Platform-specific differences](SL-PlatformDifferences) for more information.

## Tessellation & Geometry Shaders

Surface Shaders have support for simple tessellation and displacement. See documentation on [Surface Shader Tessellation](SL-SurfaceShaderTessellation) for more information.

When manually writing [Shader programs](SL-ShaderPrograms), you can use the full set of DX11 Shader model 5.0 features, including Geometry, Hull and Domain Shaders.

Tessellation and geometry shaders are only supported by a subset of graphics APIs. This is controlled by the [Shader Compilation Target level](SL-ShaderCompileTargets).

## Compute Shaders

Compute Shaders run on the graphics card and can speed up rendering. See documentation on [Compute Shaders](ComputeShaders) for more information.
