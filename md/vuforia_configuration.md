# Vuforia platform configuration settings

This section provides information about the important XR platform settings affecting development of Vuforia Augmented/Mixed Reality applications with Unity.

Here is a list of important **XR Settings** used in Vuforia's Unity integration. To access these, open the **Player** settings (__Edit__ &gt; __Project Settings__, then select the __Player__ category), then select the tab for the device you are building to):

* __Vuforia Augmented Reality support__: Enables Vuforia Augmented Reality support in your application

* __Virtual Reality SDKs__: Allows Vuforia features to be integrated into VR applications. This menu is displayed when you select the Virtual Reality Supported checkbox.

Vuforia supports the following XR SDKs:

* [Google Cardboard through Google VR SDK](https://developers.google.com/vr/cardboard/overview)

* [Google Daydream through Google VR SDK](https://developers.google.com/vr/cardboard/overview)

* [Microsoft HoloLens through Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools)

* [Vuforia SDK](https://library.vuforia.com/content/vuforia-library/en/articles/Best_Practices/Best-practices-for-hybrid-VRAR-experiences.html)

The __Vuforia VR SDK__ (in the __Virtual Reality SDKs__ list) is a stand-alone VR configuration with no external dependencies. It provides stereo rendering and distortion correction, along with head and hand tracking (with positional tracking available for Tango), and viewer profile support to define parameters of various VR headwear.

## Stereo rendering method

The stereo rendering method is only relevant when using the Vuforia Virtual Reality SDK. Android, iOS, and Windows Mixed Reality devices support Multi-Pass instancing, Single-Pass Instancing and non-instancing.

When using Vuforia Augmented Reality with another Virtual Reality SDK, stereo rendering support is determined by the Virtual Reality SDK being used.

## Supported graphics APIs

__Recommendation:__ In Unity's **Player** settings (menu: __Edit__ &gt; __Project Settings__, then select the __Player__ category), select the tab for the device you are building to open the __Other Settings__ panel and enable __Use Auto Graphics API__.


| __Android__| __iOS__ | __Windows__ |
|:---|:---|:---|
| OpenGL ES 2.0<br/>OpenGL ES 3.x| OpenGL ES 2.0<br/>OpenGL ES 3.x <br/>Metal (iOS 8+) | DirectX 11 on Windows 10 |

## Supported features

Vuforia provides a number of features to allow development of AR/MR applications.
