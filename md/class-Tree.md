#Tree Editor

Unity provides a tool called __Tree Editor__  that lets you design trees directly within the editor. This is very useful when you want to create detailed forests and jungles with different tree types and variations.

This section of the manual explains how to use the Tree Editor. Use the navigation column on the left-hand side of the page to view topics in this section.

## SpeedTree

You can use [SpeedTree Modeler](https://store.speedtree.com/) from IDV, Inc. to create trees with advanced visual effects such as smooth LOD transition, fast billboarding and natural wind animation. See Unity documentation on [SpeedTree](SpeedTree) for more information.
