# Importing models from 3D modeling software

There are two ways to import Models into Unity:

* Drag the Model file from your file browser straight into the Unity Project window.
* Copy the Model file into the Projectâ€™s Assets folder. 

Select the file in the __Project__ view and navigate to the __Model__ tab in the Inspector window to configure import options. See the [Model Import Settings window] reference documentation for details.

***Note:*** You must store Textures in a folder called __Textures__, placed inside the __Assets__ folder (next to the exported Mesh) within your Unity Project. This enables the Unity Editor to find the Textures and connect them to the generated Materials. For more information, see the [Importing Textures](class-TextureImporter) documentation.
