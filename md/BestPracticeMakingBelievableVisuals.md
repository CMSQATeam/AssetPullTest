# Making believable visuals in Unity

![](../uploads/Main/BelievableVisualsScene.jpg)

This Best Practice Guide looks at the fundamental steps for setting up a good baseline for believable visuals. The advice in this guide is provided by the Spotlight Team at Unity. The Spotlight Team help developers and content creators achieve the desired look and quality for their projects. They hear stories from across the industry, and can identify the common issues that customers face. Questions that often arise when making a Scene are “How do we build to a fairly realistic standard visual?” and "How do we make a Scene in Unity that looks believable?". 

Light, texture, scale, and material all need to work together to make digital content look real. With massive amounts of features, functions, options, properties, systems and variables to tweak, you could ask “Where do I start?” and “In what order do I proceed?”. This guide aims to answer these questions.
